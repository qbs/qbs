    \brief Loadable module.

    A LoadableModule item is a \l{Product}{product} of the \l{Product::}{type}
    \c{"loadablemodule"}. It exists for the convenience of project file authors.

    Unlike the \l{Plugin} item, the LoadableModule item cannot be build as static library and is
    installed into the same directory as \l{DynamicLibrary} items. Prefer using \l{Plugin} item in
    new code.
